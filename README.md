# NextCompanion
A minimalistic client for Nextbike. Still under early development, use with care.

I'm not a professional developer; especially not for Android. Until someone cool reviewed this source code, please consider this app bad by technical design.

## Installation
* Build it
* F-Droid (coming)
* manual APK download (coming)

## Features
[x] Sign in
[x] List of rented bikes
[x] Rent bikes
[x] Return bikes
[x] Sign out
[ ] Good error handling
[ ] Settings

## Possible features
* integration of other bike sharing systems

## This is not...
* feature rich
* the official client
* sign up on Nextbike
* read the news feed
* a map
* delete your account
* using GPS
* fancy swiping

## Motivation
tl;dr: Did not work for me. Too many crashes, completly overloaded with features, returning did not work.

The original client sent me random testing notifications like "IOS test" or "LOL" but idk, why does a bike sharing app needs notifications anyhow? It has also features like their news feed and since a recent upgrade it became unusable for me because returning depends on personal GPS location.
